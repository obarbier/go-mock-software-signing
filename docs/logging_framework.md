We need to research the logging framework space in go

Criteria for logging

conflicting maybes?


Decision:
Zerolog as it provided better example, especially on stack trace

Understand log level [LINK](https://sematext.com/blog/logging-levels/)

| Log Level |                                                                                       Importance                                                                                      |   |
|:---------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|---|
|   Fatal   | One or more key business functionalities are not working and the whole system doesnâ€™t fulfill the business functionalities.                                                           |   |
|   Error   | One or more functionalities are not working, preventing some functionalities from working correctly.                                                                                  |   |
|    Warn   | Unexpected  behavior happened inside the application, but it is continuing its work  and the key business features are operating as expected.                                         |   |
|    Info   | An event happened, the event is purely informative and can be ignored during normal operations.                                                                                       |   |
|   Debug   | A log level used for events considered to be useful during software debugging when more granular information is needed.                                                               |   |
|   Trace   | A  log level describing events showing step by step execution of your code  that can be ignored during the standard operation, but may be useful  during extended debugging sessions. |   |   


### hierarchy

TRACE -> DEBUG -> INFO -> WARN -> ERROR -> FATAL

If you set your logging framework to have the root logging level to WARN you will only get log events with WARN, ERROR, and FATAL levels
